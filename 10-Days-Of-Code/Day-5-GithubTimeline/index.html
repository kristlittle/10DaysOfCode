                    <p>GitHub continues to launch a series of products and enhancements to existing 
                        products. For the desktop, it releases Electron, Atom, and a desktop client. 
                        In terms of outreach, it launches the Bug Bounty Program, ChooseALicense.com, 
                        GitHub Classroom, GitHub Student Developer Pack, and the GitHub Engineering blog. 
                        The GitHub website also experiences multiple attacks as well as censorship from 
                        governments. In April 2014, co-founder and CEO Tom Preston-Werner resigns the 
                        company following allegations of harassment.
